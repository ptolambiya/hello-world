Okay, let's structure this Python ETL application into microservices suitable for Azure deployment, keeping scalability, maintainability, and the defined requirements in mind.

Here's a proposed microservice architecture:

Core Concepts:

FLOW: A single end-to-end data movement pipeline (Source -> Extract -> Parse/Transform -> Load -> Destination).
GROUP: A collection of FLOWs, potentially sharing a schedule or a continuous trigger (like Kafka).
Configuration Database: A central relational database (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) storing all metadata: Group definitions, Flow definitions (Source type, connection details/path/query/topic, Destination table, Mapping rules), Schedules (CRON expressions), Kafka listener configurations.
Proposed Microservices:

Configuration Service:

Responsibility: Provides a REST API (or gRPC) interface to access configuration data stored in the Configuration Database. All other services query this service instead of directly accessing the config DB.
Endpoints: Get Group details, Get Flow details (by ID or by Group), Get Source config, Get Destination config, Get Mapping rules, Get Schedules, Get Kafka listener configs.
Technology: Python (Flask/FastAPI), SQLAlchemy (or other ORM).
Azure Deployment: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Apps (ACA), or potentially Azure App Service.
Scheduler Service:

Responsibility: Reads schedule configurations (CRON timings for Groups) from the Configuration Service. At the scheduled time, it triggers the execution of all FLOWs within that GROUP by notifying the Flow Orchestrator Service.
Logic: Periodically polls the Configuration Service for schedules. Maintains an internal scheduler (like APScheduler library in Python). When a job fires, it iterates through the flows in the group and makes API calls to the Flow Orchestrator Service to start each flow execution.
Technology: Python (Flask/FastAPI + APScheduler).
Azure Deployment: AKS/ACA. Could potentially be triggered by an Azure Function with a Timer Trigger which then calls this service's API endpoint to initiate group processing.
Kafka Listener Service:

Responsibility: Reads Kafka topic configurations (topic name, associated Flow ID) from the Configuration Service. Continuously listens to the specified Kafka topics. When a message arrives, it triggers the execution of the associated FLOW by notifying the Flow Orchestrator Service, passing the Kafka message content.
Logic: Uses a Python Kafka client library (e.g., kafka-python, confluent-kafka-python). Maintains active consumers for configured topics. On message receipt, makes an API call to the Flow Orchestrator Service with the Flow ID and the message payload.
Technology: Python (using Kafka client libraries). Could be a simple Python script or wrapped in a lightweight framework if management APIs are needed.
Azure Deployment: AKS/ACA. Needs network connectivity to the Kafka cluster (e.g., Azure Event Hubs Kafka endpoint, Confluent Cloud, or self-hosted Kafka).
Flow Orchestrator Service:

Responsibility: Manages the execution lifecycle of a single FLOW instance. It coordinates the Extract, Parse/Transform, and Load steps. It's triggered by the Scheduler Service (for scheduled flows) or the Kafka Listener Service (for Kafka flows). It handles the control flow but not necessarily the bulk data flow.
Logic:
Receives a request to run a specific Flow ID (and potentially data payload from Kafka).
Queries Configuration Service for Flow details (Source, Destination, Mapping).
For non-Kafka: Calls the Extractor Service with source configuration. Receives status and location of extracted data (e.g., a path in Azure Blob Storage).
For Kafka: Uses the payload received from the Kafka Listener Service.
Calls the Parser Service with the data (or data location) and mapping configuration. Receives status and location of transformed data.
Calls the Loader Service with the transformed data location and destination configuration. Receives final status.
Logs execution status, handles basic error propagation/retries (can be enhanced with durable execution frameworks).
Technology: Python (Flask/FastAPI). Might use state management if complex orchestration or retries are needed (e.g., Azure Durable Functions concept, though implemented within the service).
Azure Deployment: AKS/ACA.
Extractor Service:

Responsibility: Connects to various data sources (CSV file path, API endpoint, Database) based on provided configuration and extracts the raw data. For large datasets, it should write the output to a temporary staging area (like Azure Blob Storage) and return the location/path instead of the data itself.
Logic: Contains adapters/drivers for each source type:
CSV: Reads from a specified path (needs access, e.g., mounted Azure Files or Blob Storage).
API: Makes HTTP requests (GET/POST), handles authentication.
Database: Uses appropriate DB drivers (cx_Oracle, pyodbc, psycopg2, etc.) to connect and execute the provided query. Fetches results.
(Note: Kafka extraction is handled by the Kafka Listener Service).
Writes extracted data (e.g., raw text, JSON lines, Parquet) to Azure Blob Storage. Returns the Blob path and potentially metadata (like detected format if not obvious).
Technology: Python (Flask/FastAPI), pandas, requests, DB drivers.
Azure Deployment: AKS/ACA. Needs necessary drivers/SDKs installed and network access to sources/Blob Storage.
Parser Service:

Responsibility: Takes raw data (or its location in Blob Storage) and mapping configuration. Parses the data (CSV, JSON, XML, delimited API response) into a structured internal format. Applies the column mappings/transformations defined in the configuration. Outputs the data in a standardized format suitable for loading (e.g., JSON Lines or Parquet in Azure Blob Storage).
Logic:
Reads data from Blob Storage (or directly if passed).
Uses appropriate parsing libraries (csv, json, xml.etree.ElementTree, pandas).
Applies column selection/renaming based on mapping rules fetched via Configuration Service (or passed by Orchestrator).
Performs basic type conversions if needed.
Writes the standardized, transformed data (e.g., List of Dictionaries serialized as JSON Lines, or a Pandas DataFrame saved as Parquet) to Azure Blob Storage. Returns the new Blob path.
Technology: Python (Flask/FastAPI), pandas (very useful here).
Azure Deployment: AKS/ACA. Needs access to Blob Storage.
Loader Service:

Responsibility: Takes the location of the standardized, transformed data (in Blob Storage) and the destination database configuration. Connects to the target database (Oracle or PostgreSQL) and loads the data efficiently.
Logic:
Reads standardized data from Blob Storage.
Connects to the target database using appropriate drivers.
Performs the insertion. Strategies for efficiency:
Bulk inserts (executemany with psycopg2, fast_executemany=True with pyodbc for SQL Server - check Oracle equivalents).
Using database-specific bulk load utilities if possible (e.g., PostgreSQL COPY, Oracle SQL*Loader - might require temporary files/more complex interaction).
Loading via Pandas to_sql (convenient but check performance for very large data).
Reports success/failure status and row counts. Handles potential DB errors.
Technology: Python (Flask/FastAPI), DB drivers (cx_Oracle, psycopg2), pandas (optional).
Azure Deployment: AKS/ACA. Needs DB drivers installed and network access to target databases/Blob Storage.
Data Flow (using Azure Blob Storage for staging):

Trigger: Scheduler or Kafka Listener -> Flow Orchestrator (with Flow ID, maybe Kafka payload).
Orchestration Start: Flow Orchestrator gets Flow config from Configuration Service.
Extract (if not Kafka): Flow Orchestrator -> Extractor Service (with source config).
Extractor Service reads source -> writes raw data to Azure Blob Storage -> returns Blob path to Flow Orchestrator.
Parse/Transform: Flow Orchestrator -> Parser Service (with raw data Blob path / Kafka payload, mapping config).
Parser Service reads data -> parses/maps -> writes standardized data to Azure Blob Storage -> returns new Blob path to Flow Orchestrator.
Load: Flow Orchestrator -> Loader Service (with standardized data Blob path, destination config).
Loader Service reads standardized data from Blob -> loads into target DB -> returns status to Flow Orchestrator.
Completion: Flow Orchestrator logs final status.
Azure Deployment Considerations:

Compute: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Apps (ACA) are excellent choices for deploying these containerized Python microservices.
Databases: Azure SQL Database or Azure Database for PostgreSQL for the Configuration DB and potentially the target DBs.
Storage: Azure Blob Storage is crucial for temporary data staging between services.
Messaging: Azure Event Hubs (with Kafka endpoint) or Confluent Cloud on Azure for Kafka source. Azure Service Bus could be used for internal communication if REST/gRPC is not preferred.
API Management: Azure API Management can act as a gateway, providing a single entry point, security, and rate limiting.
Monitoring: Azure Monitor and Application Insights for logging, metrics, tracing across services.
Security: Use Managed Identities for Azure resource access (Blob, DBs), secure network configurations (VNETs, Private Endpoints), and secure API communication (e.g., Azure AD authentication via API Management).
CI/CD: Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for building container images, pushing to Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploying to AKS/ACA.
This structure separates concerns, allows independent scaling of different parts (e.g., you might need more Loader Service instances than Scheduler Service instances), and leverages Azure-native services for storage, databases, and potentially messaging/scheduling triggers.
