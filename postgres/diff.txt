Data Types	Some Oracle-specific data types (e.g., VARCHAR2 with byte/char semantics, NUMBER with precision and scale, DATE vs. TIMESTAMP) might not have direct equivalents in PostgreSQL, requiring careful mapping and potential data conversion and application code adjustments.
SQL Syntax Differences	Significant differences exist in SQL syntax for various operations, including date and time functions, string manipulation functions, conditional statements (e.g., DECODE), and analytic functions. This necessitates rewriting a substantial portion of the SQL code in applications, reports, and scripts.
PL/SQL vs. PL/pgSQL	Oracle uses PL/SQL for stored procedures, packages, functions, and triggers, while PostgreSQL uses PL/pgSQL. These are different procedural languages with distinct syntax, built-in functions, and error handling mechanisms, requiring a complete rewrite of all PL/SQL code.
Packages	Oracle's concept of packages (grouping related procedures, functions, and variables) doesn't have a direct equivalent in PostgreSQL. While functions and procedures can be created, the organizational structure of packages needs to be re-architected, potentially using schemas or other grouping mechanisms.
Functions	Oracle's built-in functions and user-defined functions written in PL/SQL need to be rewritten in PL/pgSQL, accounting for syntax and semantic differences. Some Oracle functions might not have direct counterparts in PostgreSQL, requiring alternative implementations.
Triggers	While PostgreSQL also supports triggers, the syntax and available options might differ from Oracle triggers. Complex Oracle triggers might require significant modifications or a complete rewrite to achieve the same functionality in PostgreSQL.
Sequences	Both Oracle and PostgreSQL support sequences, but the syntax for creating and manipulating them might have minor differences. However, this is generally one of the less challenging aspects of migration.
Large Objects (LOBs)	Handling of large binary objects (BLOBs) and character large objects (CLOBs) might have implementation differences in terms of storage, access methods, and performance characteristics, potentially requiring changes in application code that interacts with LOB data.
Transactions and Concurrency	While both databases support ACID transactions, the default isolation levels and concurrency control mechanisms can differ. Applications relying on specific Oracle transaction behaviors might need adjustments to ensure consistency and correctness in PostgreSQL.
Performance Tuning	Performance tuning strategies and available tools differ significantly between Oracle and PostgreSQL. Existing Oracle database performance tuning might not directly translate to PostgreSQL, requiring a new learning curve and potentially significant effort to optimize performance after migration.
Tooling and Ecosystem	Organizations might have invested heavily in Oracle-specific tools for development, administration, monitoring, and backup. Migrating to PostgreSQL requires adopting and learning a new set of tools, which can involve costs and a learning curve for the database and development teams.
Feature Parity	While PostgreSQL is a feature-rich database, some very specific or advanced Oracle features (e.g., Real Application Clusters (RAC), Data Guard, advanced partitioning options) might not have direct equivalents or might be implemented differently in PostgreSQL, potentially requiring changes in application architecture or acceptance of slightly different functionality.
Application Compatibility	Applications might be tightly coupled with Oracle-specific SQL syntax, data types, stored procedures, or error codes. Migrating requires a thorough review and modification of the application code to ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL, which can be a time-consuming and complex task.
Migration Complexity and Cost	The sheer complexity of migrating a large Oracle database with numerous objects and a significant amount of custom code (procedures, packages, functions) can lead to high migration costs in terms of effort, time, and potential downtime. Thorough planning, testing, and skilled resources are essential, but the inherent differences make it a challenging undertaking.
